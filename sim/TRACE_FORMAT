The trace is a gzipped text file. The text file consists of
multiple lines, each line corresponding to a memory request. The
format of each line is as follows:

<ICOUNT> <INSTRUCTION POINTER> <VIRTUAL ADDRESS> <PHYSICAL ADDRESS> <SIZE> <TYPE>

ICOUNT -> instruction count of the instruction that generated the request
INSTRUCTION POINTER -> address of the instruction that generated the request
VIRTUAL ADDRESS -> virtual address of the data being accessed
PHYSICAL ADDRESS -> physical address of the data being accessed
SIZE -> size of the data being accessed
TYPE -> 0 - READ, 1 - WRITE, 3 - WRITEBACK

A CPU-generated trace will contain only READs and WRITEs. A
cache-filtered trace (like the sample.gz trace) may contain
WRITEBACKs generated by the cache as well.
